My name is Yebowen Hu, third-year Ph.D. student from the University of Central Florida, fortunatly co-adviced by **Prof. [Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/)** and **Prof. [Hassan Foroosh](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~foroosh/)**. Before I join UCF, I received my M.S. degree from *University of Florida*, *Gainesville FL*, major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Even earlier, I got my B.S. degree from [*Central South University*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_South_University), [*Changsha China*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changsha), major in Electrical Automation and Engineering.

I am passionate about researching topics on **AI Alignment**, **Summarization** and **Model Evaluation** in the era of **Large Language Model**. Through my research, I aim to contribute meaningful insights to this area of research and shaping the future AI assistants for social benifits.
