My name is Yebowen Hu, third-year Ph.D. student from the University of Central Florida, fortunatly co-adviced by **Prof. [Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/)** and **Prof. [Hassan Foroosh](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~foroosh/)**. Before I join UCF, I received my M.S. degree from University of Florida, major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Even earlier, I got my B.S. degree from Central South University, *Changsha*, China, major in Electrical Automation.

I am passionate about researching topics on **AI Alignment**, **Summarization** and **Dataset Aggregation** in the era of **Large Language Model**. Through my research, I aim to contribute meaningful insights to this area of study and shaping the future artificial intelligent.
